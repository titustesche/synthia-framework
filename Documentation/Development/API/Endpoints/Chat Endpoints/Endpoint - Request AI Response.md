# Documentation
This Endpoint is the updated Version of the now deprecated sendRequest() method which belonged to `comm.inc.js` and handled the entire communication as well as deciding what to send to be executed.

This updated Version lives in the backend rather than the frontend and will handle everything from establishing a communication to telling the frontend how to display a message
